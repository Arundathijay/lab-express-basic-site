<h2>Dog Adoption Tips – Bringing Home a New Rescue Dog</h2>
<hr />
<div class="adoption">
  <p>Bringing home a shelter dog that you adopt may be a rescued stray or a dog
    that someone has voluntarily surrendered for adoption.
    <br />
    Whether he was born in the bushes behind the laundromat or an adolescent
    abandoned on the streets by his once-upon-a-time owner, the streetwise stray
    can be a real challenge to incorporate into your life. The famous “he
    followed me home, can I keep him, Mom?” canine is a special animal that
    needs time and space, patience, and understanding.
    <br />
    The first few days in your home are special and critical for a pet. Your new
    dog will be confused about where he is and what to expect from you. Setting
    up some clear structure with your family for your dog will be paramount in
    making as smooth a transition as possible.</p>
  <p>
    The biggest help anyone can offer, Bolokhovets says, is to adopt the animals
    under her care. But on top of the risk of the journey across Ukraine amid
    war, the process of adoption to the EU became more complex in March, when
    the Czech Republic -- where many of Shelter Friends' animals found their
    forever homes before the war -- put a halt on accepting dogs from Ukraine
    that are not family pets.

<h2>Before You Bring Your Dog Home:
</h2>

<div class="steps-adopt">
  <ol>
    <li>Determine where your dog will be spending most of his time. Because he
      will be under a lot of stress with the change of environment (from a
      shelter or foster home to your house), he may forget any housebreaking (if
      any) he’s learned. Often a kitchen will work best for easy clean-up.</li>
    <li>If you plan on crate training your dog, be sure to have a crate set up
      and ready to go for when you bring your new dog home. Find out more about
      <a href="crate training your dog.">crate training your dog.</a></li>
    <li>Dog-proof the area where your pooch will spend most of his time during
      the first few months. This may mean taping loose electrical cords to
      baseboards; storing household chemicals on high shelves; removing plants,
      rugs, and breakables; setting up the crate, and installing baby gates.</li>
    <li>raining your dog will start the first moment you have him. Take time to
      create a vocabulary list everyone will use when giving your dog
      directions. This will help prevent confusion and help your dog learn his
      commands more quickly. Not sure which commands to use? Check out
